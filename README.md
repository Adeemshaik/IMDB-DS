Assignment: Problem Statement
In this assignment, you will try to find some interesting insights into a few movies released between 1916 and 2016, using Python. This is a compulsory individual assignment wherein you will download a movie dataset, write Python code to explore the data, gain insights into the movies, actors, directors, and collections, and submit the code.


About the assignment
Where do I get the data from?

You can download the movie dataset from the bottom of this page.

 

Where do I write the code?

Download the ‘Movie Assignment.ipynb’ file from the bottom of this page. It is a commented Jupyter IPython Notebook file in which all the instructions and tasks to be performed are mentioned.

 

How do I submit the assignment?

Upload your ‘ipynb’ solution file in the ‘submission’ section on the next page.

 

Some tips before starting the assignment

Read through each of the instructions carefully, identify the task to be performed, and only then proceed to write the required code. Don’t perform any incorrect analysis or look for information that isn’t required for the assignment.
In some cases, the variable names have already been assigned, and you just need to write code against them. In other cases, the names to be given are mentioned in the instructions. We strongly advise you to use the mentioned names only.
Always keep inspecting your data frame after you have performed a particular set of operations.
 There might be some subtasks which involve the use of functions which you may not have used before.  In such cases, you just need to do a simple search on Google/Stack Overflow to gain an understanding of the function. Please understand that solving this assignment is also a learning process and research is a part of this process.
For plot-related questions, please make sure you are using the appropriate chart size for better readability. If the task involves the comparison of two charts at a time, plot them side by side using subplots to ease the comparison.
There are some checkpoints given in the IPython notebook provided. They're just useful pieces of information you can use to check if the result you have obtained after performing a particular task is correct or not.
